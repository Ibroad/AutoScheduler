The original version coded with ChatGPT's help was moved under `byChatGPT`. It can run without error but cant't meet my requirements actually, so I modified it and produce this new version.

This new version in `schedule.py` was coded with copliot's help and it can meet my requirements.
1. At least one person is on duty for each shift.
2. Some shifts are better to have two people on duty (high priority shifts).  
3. One person is assigned to 2 shifts at best, 3 shifts at most.  
4. Don't occupy the period that has been already declared as unavailable by people in the `unavailable.xlsx`.

Elaborating the flowchart of the program become the most important thing for a programmer. AI assistants like Copliot and ChatGPT can offset your lack of proficiency in grammer of the programming language, but you definately can't make your ideal come true unless you can draw a clear flowchart in your mind or on paper.

So, clarify your requirments first, draw a clear flowchart, and dive in coding lastly.
