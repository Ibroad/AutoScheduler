The original version coded with ChatGPT's help was moved under `byChatGPT`. It can run without error but cant't meet my requirements actually, so I modified it and produce this new version.

This version in `schedule.py` was coded with copliot's help and it can meet my requirements.

Elaborating the flowchart of the program become the most important thing for a programmer. AI assistants like Copliot and ChatGPT can offset your lack of proficiency in grammer of the programming language, but you definately can't make your ideal come true unless you can draw a clear flowchart in your mind or on paper.

So, clarify your requirments first, draw a clear flowchart, and dive in coding lastly.
